Imagine teams of kids under sixteen hacking away at America’s midterm elections. They are looking for unprotected systems to break into, on a mission to turn found vulnerabilities into a guide on how to protect our election infrastructure. While for many of us this may seem counterintuitive, it is exactly the challenge turned global competition that kids at DEF CON’s r00tz Asylum embarked on this week.

DEF CON is the world’s largest hacker gathering, bringing together the best security minds from around the globe. For nearly a decade, kids and their parents have been part of the r00tz conference where hackers young and old share their expertise to help raise the next generation of cyber security experts we now so desperately need. Notably, girls represent almost half of the kids attending r00tz every year who are excited about math, hardware hacking, cryptography, and social engineering.

So why election hacking? Last year, the Voting Machine Hacking Village debuted at DEF CON. Within the first five minutes, ‘white hats’ drawn to the challenge of finding the vulnerabilities in vote counting devices had succeeded. The results were included in DEF CON’s report on vulnerabilities in the US election infrastructure. This year, the next generation of hackers, the r00tz kids, is joining the effort to call attention to just how insecure some of our voter registration and other election processes are.

With all the attention on election security following the 2016 Presidential cycle, our political infrastructure is almost as insecure as it was two years ago according to recent reports. Of course, some vulnerabilities are hard to fix in time for the upcoming midterms, including the divisive public discourse making us susceptible to manipulation. Yet the hardware and software security issues we can solve. And r00tz’s hacker kids will soon be trying to protect the elections from both script-kiddies and nation-state adversaries.

Less than 90 days away from the next elections, as more states accommodate an increasingly digital population and many election functions move online, state and local websites remain easy targets to breach. To help secure the digital infrastructure interfacing with the public during the elections, young hackers will be taking a run at breaking into replicas of the Secretary of State websites for several battleground states including Florida, Iowa, Michigan, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin.

While compromising the websites of state and local election offices may not be a difficult task for the experienced adult hackers who came to Las Vegas this week, watching kids breach the exact clones of these critical components of the US national infrastructure will certainly help raise awareness on election security.

In this two-day competition at r00tz, the hacker teams are given targets that look and function like the real-life web portals used by the top battleground states to register voters and disseminate information about early voting, election results, and polling locations. It is easy to imagine how detrimental it may be to have these information flows disrupted on or around Election Day.

Mentors drawn from the public and private sectors, including information security and political campaign experts, will coach the young white-hat hackers on ethics and the election process so they better understand their targets and the significance of each function they carry in the elections. With that, the teams will begin exploring the live copies of the sites of the Secretaries of State to break down the security features that protect them.

The winners of the Hack the Election competition will be offered bounties to empower them to pursue their interest in hunting security bugs in critical public systems. For every kid passionate about technology, this competition is designed to be a hands-on educational opportunity to see just how essential security is in every website and app, and also how impactful each young white-hat hacker can be in protecting these important national systems. After all, hacking America’s elections should never be child’s play.
